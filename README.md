# Mixed Number Class (C++)

A C++ class that models mixed numbers and supports full arithmetic,
comparison, and stream input/output using operator overloading.

## Key Features
- Operator overloading: `+ - * / < > <= >= == != << >>`
- Automatic normalization and simplification
- Conversion between mixed and improper fractions
- Robust handling of invalid input
- Separate test and demo drivers

## Tech Stack
- C++ (C++17)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Operator Overloading

## Build & Run

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp mixed.cpp -o main
./main
